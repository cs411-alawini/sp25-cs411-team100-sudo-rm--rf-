## Project Summary

MedWise is a web application designed to help patients manage their medication safety by analyzing potential drug-drug and drug-food interactions based on their past prescription history. By integrating Electronic Health Record (EHR) data with standardized drug interaction databases such as RxNorm, Diet-Drug Interaction Database (DDID), nSIDES Database, and DrugBank, the system will alert users to potential harmful interactions and provide guidance on safe medication and dietary choices.
